### Git Workflow  
Git is a version control tool.  
In general, we would first have a master branch which includes all the original files.  
Then, after we start to work, we could build other branches from our current branch. This process would duplicate all the files from the current branch. Simply type the following command to create a new branch and move to the new branch you just made.  

    git branch <branchname>  
    git checkout <branchname>
